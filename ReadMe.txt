This console application comes with some default data. Be sure to add data to headlineterms.txt and domains.txt to increase accuracy. Under domains.txt, under each domain, is the percent of the domain's content that is clickbait.

Simple enter a headline, for example "You'll never believe what happened when this person stepped outside", followed by the headline's domain (excluding the .com/.net etc.), for example, "time" or "huffingtonpost". The application will then analyze if the headline is clickbait or not.

Adjust sensativity parameters under the main() function to optimize results for your data.
